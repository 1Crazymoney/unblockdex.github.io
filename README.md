## Welcome to UnblockDEX

AtomicDEX is a secure wallet and non-custodial decentralized exchange rolled into one application. You can learn about AtomicDEX on [https://atomicdex.io](https://atomicdex.io).

The official AtomicDEX application is geo-blocked in several countries, like US. But there are community forks (copies) of AtomicDEX application which are not geoblocked, and can be used all over the world without any restrictions. These non-geoblocked forks of AtomicDEX are all using the same decentralised exchange network and share the same orderbooks and liquidity. The only few differences you will notice is these different forks have default coins activated for their own projects instead of KMD etc. and some graphical theme changes. So, you can download any of the forks of AtomicDEX which doesn't has any geo-blocking and freely trade your cryptocurrencies on a truely decentralised exchange.
